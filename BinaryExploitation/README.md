## Research
- This domain was completely alien to me and took a lot of learning, but I also enjoyed the process.

- To solve these challenges, I had to learn many things from scratch such as **assembly**, **registers**, **gdb** and the whole **computer architecture** in general.

- My first week was spent in learning the pre-requisites itself.

- Also, I completed `pwn.college` modules to really understand the low-level to get a better grasp on the topic.

- I learned a lot from these challenges.

- Following are the comprehensive notes which I created during the process:
