# Your First Overflow (easy)

## Challenge
Overflow a buffer on the stack to set the right conditions to obtain the flag!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wmzaUnZsWHcsWWiZZKtiGDklzT_.dlDOywyNyAzNzEzW}`
- I know what I have to do but the instructions were unclear. The home directory was empty and I had no idea whether to write my own C file and execute it such that it would overwrite the buffer so look for pre-existing files. If the latter, I didn't know where.
- I took help of `SensAI` - the builtin AI help assistant for pwn college.
- It pointed me in the right direction by telling me to run the command `ls -l /challenge`.
- The directory contained 3 files:
    - `DESCRIPTION.md`
    - `binary-exploitation-first-overflow-w.c` - the `.c` file
    - `binary-exploitation-first-overflow-w` - the executable.
- Also, the files are owned by `root` but are also executable for all with the `suid` bit set.
- So I simply execute the executable file.
- The prompt asks me to enter an input which is more than 4096 bytes.
- I do the same and am rewarded with the flag.

### New Learnings
- C is a language which provides low-level power to the developer. It will not clean up the code for you.
- This results in one of many problems known as *Memory Errors*.
- If we provide an input which is greater than its allocated size, it will over-write the buffer which can be really disastrous in some situations.
- e.g. A custom payload could be created which could run the malicious script at the perfect memory location by over-writing the memory buffer using this method.
