# DOM XSS in `innerHTML` sink using source `location.search`

## Challenge
 This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search blog functionality. It uses an innerHTML assignment, which changes the HTML contents of a div element, using data from location.search.

To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the alert function.


### Solve
- We need to call the alert function on the webpage by performing an XSS attack.
- Thus, in the searchbox, we pass the payload:
 ```html
 <img src=x onerror=alert("1")>
 ```
 - Hit the search button.
 - We get the alert with the message `1`.
 

 ### New Learnings
 - **`onerror` attribute**
    - If the `<img>` tag fails to load the image provided in its `src` attribute, the **JS** code in the `onerror` attribute is executed.
    - This is a very common way to execute an XSS attack.
    - Attackers deliberately provide wrong path in the `src` tag in order to execute the malicious **JS** code they inject through the custom payload.
