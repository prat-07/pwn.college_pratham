# More SQLi

## Challenge
We are given a link to a website and asked to find the flag there.\
This challenge involved a login page that appeared to be vulnerable to SQL injection (SQLi). The goal was to exploit this vulnerability to bypass authentication and retrieve the flag.

### Solve
**Flag:** `picoCTF{G3tting_5QL_1nJ3c7I0N_l1k3_y0u_sh0ulD_c8b7cc2a}`\
Start by first entering simple credentials
- Username: test
- Password: test

After submitting, the response revealed a SQL query structure:
```
username: test
password: test
SQL query: SELECT id FROM users WHERE password = 'test' AND username = 'test'
```

Seeing the raw SQL query in the response confirmed that the application was directly embedding user input into the query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

Knowing that `1=1` always evaluates to true, I tried the following payload in password field and kept the username as `test`.
```
' OR 1=1; - //
```
Since `1=1` is always true, the query returns a valid user, allowing me to bypass authentication successfully and shows me the following page:

I repeat the same SQL injection payload with the **BurpSuite** and the response contained:
- User details, and 
- The flag.


### New Learnings
- SQL injection occurs when user input is not properly sanitized before being executed in a query.
- Using `1=1` allows authentication bypasses when the query lacks proper prepared statements.
- Burp Suite is an excellent tool for intercepting, modifying, and replaying requests to test for vulnerabilities.
