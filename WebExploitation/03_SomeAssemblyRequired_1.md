# Some Assembly Required 1

## Challenge
- Provided with a link.
- After clicking on it, I was redirected to a webpage which asked to enter the flag.

### Solve
**Flag:** `picoCTF{8857462f9e30faae4d037e5e25fee1ce}`
- As always, the first instinct was to `inspect` the page.
- In the resources, I see a section named `wasm://`.
- Since this challenge needs some assembly, and `wasm` is an assembler, I click on it.
- There are two files.
- After opening one, I was asked to reload the page to debug that.
- It contained long assembly code.
- Scrolling to the bottom, I find the flag.
