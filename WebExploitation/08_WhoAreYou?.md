# Who are you?

## Challenge
We are required to pass all the checks so the website lets us in and display the flag.

**Hint:** We are provided a link to an **RFC** for **HTTP** requests.


### Solve
**Flag:** `picoCTF{http_h34d3rs_v3ry_c0Ol_much_w0w_8d5d8d77}`

- Upon entering the site we see the message:
    - ***Only people who use the official `PicoBrowser` are allowed on this site!***
    - This hints that we must make use of **Burp Suite** to edit the initial **HTTP** requests.
    - To pass this step, I edited the `User-Agent` of the request to `PicoBrowser`.
- After this, we are prompted with a new message:
    - ***I don't trust users visiting from another site.***
    - This was a reference to the “referer” policy so by simply setting this to the origin domain(`mercury.picoctf.net:46199`) it accepted the connection.
    > Note: Not only the current condition, but the previous ones must also be true. Therefore, we must copy the previously edited commands and add on top of them.
- Next message is:
    - ***Sorry, this site only worked in 2018.***
    - To bypass this condition, we provide a random(but a valid) date from 2018 for the `Date` attribute, e.g. `Fri, 15 July 2018 14:00:00 GMT`.
- Next message is:
    - ***I don't trust users who can be tracked.***
    - This hints at the `DNT`(Do Not Track) header.
    - If its value is set to `1`, it indicates that the user does not want to be tracked. So we do the same.
- Next message is:
    - ***This website is only for people from Sweden.***
    - This means we need an IP-address from Sweden.
    - We search for an IP from Sweden on the internet and set that value to the header `X-Forwarded-For`.
- Next(the final message) is:
    - ***You're in Sweden but you don't speak Swedish?***
    - For this, we set the `Accept-Language` header to the value `se-SV`.
- Finally we are rewarded with the message:
    - ***What can I say except, you are welcome***
    - And the `flag`.


### New Learnings
- Editing the initial **HTTP** requests to alter the packet information.
- Various headers contain different types of information about an online user.
- Different types of headers:
    - `User-Agent` - tells about the browser from which the request was made.
    - `Referer` - tells the address of web page from which the request was made.
    - `DNT` - tell the user's tracking preference. 0 for track and 1 for do not.
    - `X-Forwarded-For` - identifies the originating IP address of a client.
    - `Accept-Language` - tells the natural language and locale that a client **prefers** for receiving content.
