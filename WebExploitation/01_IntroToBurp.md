### Solve
**Flag:** `picoCTF{#0TP_Bypvss_SuCc3$S_c94b61ac}`\
Since the challenge name is `IntroToBurp`, it requires us to use the `Burp Suite` tool to solve this challenge.
- Open `Burp Suite`
- Click on `Open Browser`
- Click on `Proxy`
- Turn on interception
- Also, in settings check `intercept responses` button which not only intercepts the requests, but also the responses from the `HTTP`.
- After submitting the details on the site, click `Forward` two times in Burp for it to allow `POST` and `GET` request for our packets.
- We see that it gives us a `CSRF` token
- It asks for an OTP
- Tried providing a random one e.g. `8008`
- Output: `Invalid OTP`
- Repeat the above steps once again.
- This time, after writing a random OTP, remove the line containing the OTP from the `CSRF` token. And then forward.
- Voila!! I successfully bypassed the 2FA.

### New Learnings
- Basics of `Burp Suite`
- Inspecting and Intercepting HTTP traffic
- Modifying and replaying requests <br>

A CSRF token is a secret, unpredictable value a server issues and embeds in a user’s web form or session; the browser must send it back with state-changing requests.
It proves the request originated from the legitimate site (not a third‑party page), preventing cross‑site request forgery. \
In this challenge, we modify this to bypass the 2FA.
