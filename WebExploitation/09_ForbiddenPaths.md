# Forbidden Paths

## Challenge
Can you get the flag? We know that the website files live in `/usr/share/nginx/html/` and the flag is at `/flag.txt` but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

### Solve
**Flag:** ` picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5a6fcbc}`

- After launching the challenge instance, we arrive at the following website:

- The website reads out the file we type into it.
- To test the format, I pass the file name `oliver-twist.txt` as it is to see the response. It works. Therefore, we simply have to type the path to the flag and the website will read it out to us.
- But the absolute paths are blocked.
- So we use the relative path: `../../../../flag.txt`. By using the information provided, we know the flag is in `root` folder which is four directories up.
- The flag is revealed.
